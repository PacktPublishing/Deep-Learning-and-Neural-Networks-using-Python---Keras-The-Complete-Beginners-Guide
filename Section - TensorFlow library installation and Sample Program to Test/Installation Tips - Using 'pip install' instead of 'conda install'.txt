Installation Tips: Using 'pip install' instead of 'conda install'
While installing Theano or TensorFlow and Keras, (as shown in the next lecture)



using 'conda install' commands will be slow and may fail to resolve.



So I recommend to use the 'pip install' instead of 'conda install'



For example:

pip install theano    (if applicable)



pip install tensorflow
 
pip install keras
